Reflection:
I built this calculator on my own, from scratch, after learning fundamentals of javascript.

Layout (html) and styling (css) part was pretty easy since the aim was to test and practice javascript understanding.

I succeeded to built this project on my second day of attempt. The first time I had done the html, and css part, but struggled with JS part. After feeling of frustration, I realized that I didn't even know what I wanted to do, and I needed to break the problem into smaller parts and an algorithm for each part, e.g storing inputs into variables, calculation and so on. So, I made a Flow Chart for each part, and then converted them into code, test and debug them, and then move on to the next part and repeat the same method. I would still get errors but mainly syntax related so I would easily look that up on google and find the solution.
